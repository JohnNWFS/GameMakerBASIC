âœ… Already Implemented (for reference)
PRINT, LET, GOTO, INPUT, IF, CLS, END, REM, FOR/NEXT, WHILE/WEND, GOSUB/RETURN, BGCOLOR, PAUSE

ðŸ”¹ Easy / Low Complexity
These are standalone or single-line commands.

DATA / READ / RESTORE

DATA: Defines values in program lines.

READ: Reads values sequentially from DATA.

RESTORE: Resets the read pointer.

Would require a global.data_list, global.data_pointer, and a pass to collect DATA lines at program start.

DIM

Declares arrays. Could store in global.basic_variables as arrays (e.g., ARR(3) â†’ ARR = [val0, val1, val2, val3]).

RANDOMIZE

Seeds the RNG, useful before calling RND.

STOP

Like END but optionally allows resuming later.

ðŸ”¸ Medium Complexity
Require changes to the interpreterâ€™s program flow or memory model.

ON GOTO / ON GOSUB

Uses a numeric expression to jump to one of several destinations.

ON X GOTO 100, 200, 300

DEF FN

Custom functions. BASIC syntax like DEF FNX(Y) = Y^2 + 1.

Likely overkill right now but doable with string parsing and token capture.

ðŸ”º Higher Complexity
Require runtime memory allocation and indexable data access.

String functions (LEFT$, RIGHT$, MID$, LEN, CHR$, ASC)

Would require extending expression evaluator to support these.

Array math and slicing

A(1) = A(2) + A(3)

Requires robust variable parsing to differentiate between scalar and indexed access.

MODES:
Your MODE-based architecture is a **sound and extensible approach** that mirrors classic computer systems like the VIC-20, Commodore 64, and early IBM PCs. You're capturing the essence of those machines: separate modes for text vs graphics, with dedicated logic and renderers. Here's an evaluation of your plan, along with recommendations.

## âœ… Summary of Your Plan

### 1. **`MODE 0` (Text Mode â€“ Current)**

* Already implemented in `rm_basic_interpreter` using `obj_basic_interpreter` and text rendering with line buffers.
* Uses string output, colors, and scrollable text.

### 2. **`MODE 1` (Tile Graphics Mode)**

* A new room or overlay object will handle graphics:

  * A **tilemap-like grid**, e.g. 40Ã—25 of 32Ã—32 sprites.
  * Sprites represent characters or graphical elements (frame-based sprite strip, indexed by value 0â€“255).
  * Controlled via new BASIC commands like `PLOT`, `DRAW`, or `CHARAT`.

### 3. **`MODE 2` (Pixel Mode)**

* True pixel access (e.g. `PSET`, `LINE`, `CIRCLE`).
* Would require surface drawing or pixel arrays.
* Ideal for dynamic pixel manipulation.

---

## ðŸ§  Analysis & Recommendations

### âœ” Why Your Plan Is Solid

* **Matches Retro Hardware Metaphors**: Commodore used mode switching between text (PETSCII) and bitmap. Your MODE command echoes this.
* **Modularity**: Each MODE having its own interpreter/renderer object is clean. Objects can specialize without bloating `obj_basic_interpreter`.
* **Flexible Expansion**: You could implement Mode 3, Mode 4, etc. in the future (e.g., sprite overlay, waveform audio visualization).
* **Room-based Switching**: Keeps memory and logic scoped per mode, preventing conflicts between text and graphics pipelines.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Tips

### A. MODE Command

Have `basic_cmd_mode(arg)`:

```gml
switch (real(arg)) {
    case 0: room_goto(rm_basic_interpreter); break;
    case 1: room_goto(rm_graphic_tiles); break;
    case 2: room_goto(rm_graphic_pixels); break;
}
```

Each room would include a variant of `obj_basic_interpreter` AND the appropriate drawing controller (`obj_graphics_tilemode`, `obj_graphics_pixmode`, etc.).

---

### B. MODE 1 â€“ Tile-Based Graphics

**Setup:**

* Global 2D array or 1D ds\_grid: `global.char_grid[columns, rows]`
* Sprite: 256-frame sheet, 32Ã—32 or 16Ã—16 tiles
* Draw using:

```gml
draw_sprite(spr_chars, value, x * 32, y * 32);
```

**New BASIC Commands:**

* `PLOT x, y, code` â€“ sets grid position
* `CLEAR code` â€“ fills with a value
* `COLOR index` â€“ sets current tile color (optional)
* `DRAWSTR x, y, "HELLO"` â€“ auto-places characters

---

### C. MODE 2 â€“ Pixel Graphics

**Options:**

* Use `draw_pixel`, `draw_line`, or draw on a surface
* Surface buffer for `PSET x, y, c`, `LINE x1, y1, x2, y2`, `CIRCLE x, y, r`
* Needs full coordinate access and color handling

---

### D. Object Architecture (Best Practice)

| Object                  | Role                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `obj_basic_interpreter` | Handles parsing + logic, shared across all modes |
| `obj_text_renderer`     | Present in MODE 0 room only                      |
| `obj_graphics_tilemode` | Present in MODE 1, interprets PLOT/CLEAR/CHARAT  |
| `obj_graphics_pixmode`  | Present in MODE 2, handles PSET/LINE/etc.        |

Decouple display logic from `obj_basic_interpreter`. Youâ€™ll gain more control and cleaner specialization.

## ðŸ“ˆ Suggested Command Rollout by Mode

| Command               | Mode  | Description                      |
| --------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| `MODE`                | 0,1,2 | Switch between text and graphics |
| `PLOT x, y, c`        | 1     | Set tile code at position        |
| `CHARAT x, y`         | 1     | Return tile value                |
| `PSET x, y, color`    | 2     | Set pixel                        |
| `LINE x1,y1,x2,y2`    | 2     | Draw line                        |
| `CIRCLE x, y, r`      | 2     | Draw circle                      |
| `CLEAR`               | 1,2   | Reset display                    |
| `DRAWSTR x, y, "TXT"` | 1     | Fast text in tile mode           |

---

## ðŸ“Ž Optional Enhancements

* Add `GETMODE()` function (returns current mode)
* Maintain variables like `CURX`, `CURY` for drawing state
* Add `SPRITE` command in higher modes for displaying custom art

---

## ðŸš¦ Final Verdict

**Your approach is excellent.** It's grounded in retro computing principles but adapts well to modern GameMaker workflows. Going with:

* Room-based separation
* Interpreter reuse
* Specialized render/controller objects per mode
  ...gives you a **scalable, organized framework**.

If you'd like, I can scaffold the `basic_cmd_mode()` function and a starting `obj_graphics_tilemode` with grid drawing logic and a `PLOT` command.
