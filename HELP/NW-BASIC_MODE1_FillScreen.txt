Filling the Screen in NW-BASIC (MODE 1)

When working in MODE 1,32, the screen is a fixed grid of tile cells. Each cell can be addressed by column and row coordinates, starting at (0,0) in the top-left corner. The coordinate order for drawing functions is:

    col, row, character

This has been verified by placing characters at (0,0) and (1,0) and observing that the second character appears to the right of the first.

There are two main ways to fill the screen with a repeated character:

---

1. Using CHARAT in Nested Loops  
This is the direct but slow method. It places one character at a time by iterating over every column and row.

10 MODE 1,32 : BGCOLOR BLACK : COLOR WHITE : CLS
20 FONT "DEFAULT_32"
30 COLS = 40
40 ROWS = 25
50 FOR R = 0 TO ROWS - 1
60   FOR C = 0 TO COLS - 1
70     CHARAT C, R, 64
80   NEXT C
90 NEXT R
100 PAUSE
110 END

- 64 is the ASCII code for "@".  
- This guarantees every cell is set, but runs more slowly since each tile is updated individually.

---

2. Using PRINTAT with REPEAT$  
This is the fast method. It builds a full line of repeated characters and prints the string at once.

10 MODE 1,32 : BGCOLOR BLACK : COLOR WHITE : CLS
20 FONT "DEFAULT_32"
30 COLS = 40
40 ROWS = 25
50 LINE$ = REPEAT$("@", COLS)
60 FOR R = 0 TO ROWS - 1
70   PRINTAT 0, R, LINE$
80 NEXT R
90 PAUSE
100 END

- REPEAT$("@", COLS) generates a single string with 40 "@" characters.  
- PRINTAT 0, R, LINE$ writes the whole row in one call, which is much faster than updating cell by cell.

---

Notes for Developers
- Use the CHARAT loop if you need fine-grained control (e.g., placing different characters per column).  
- Use the PRINTAT + REPEAT$ method if you want to quickly fill rows with the same character.  
- Both approaches are correct and respect the (col, row, char) coordinate system of NW-BASIC.

Performance tip:
- PRINTAT is preferable for drawing menus and banners.  
- CHARAT is better for per-cell graphics (like a tilemap).
