function save_undo_state() {
    // Placeholder for undo system
    // Eventually, you could push a copy of global.program_lines to a stack
	/// TODO: Implement undo functionality for BASIC editor
/// --------------------------------------------------
/// This function should snapshot the current program state so it can be restored later via an "UNDO" command.
/// A stack-based approach is recommended, where each saved state is pushed onto a list (e.g., global.undo_stack).
///
/// Suggested structure per snapshot:
/// - A ds_map with keys like "global.program_lines", "global.line_numbers", and optionally "cursor_pos"
/// - Each key maps to a *copy* (not a reference) of the original ds_map or ds_list
///
/// Pseudocode for future implementation:
/// ```gml
/// var snapshot = ds_map_create();
/// ds_map_add_list(snapshot, "global.line_numbers", ds_list_copy(global.line_numbers));
/// ds_map_add_map(snapshot, "global.program_lines", ds_map_copy(global.program_lines));
/// ds_stack_push(global.undo_stack, snapshot);
/// ```
///
/// Don't forget to:
/// - Create `global.undo_stack` once during initialization (e.g., in obj_globals)
/// - Clean up with `ds_map_destroy()` and `ds_list_destroy()` when popping or discarding states
///
/// For now, this is a placeholder to suppress runtime errors.
